## What is Edspective?

To be perfectly honest, we don't quite know yet. But we have a semblance of a <a href="/plan" target="_blank">plan</a> and a burning will to help students and the world's education systems achieve their full potential. For now, let's call it a movement to lend a healthy new perspective on college and admissions in the U.S., with the hope that this "edspective" will trickle down into feeder secondary and primary education systems.

## Who are our Ambassadors?

As part of the Cornell Student Assembly Health and Wellness committee, she works to address student health concerns, including a proposal to make Cornell a tobacco-free campus.

**Trent Kannegieter** is a first year at Yale, where he plans to study some combination of history and social sciences. Born and raised in Daphne, Alabama, he seeks to both bridge divides in communication and provide access of information to those in areas without established educational pipelines. On campus, he competes with the Yale Debate Association, writes for The Politic, and works with the Yale International Relations Association. He enjoys tennis, playing the melodica, and watching esoteric standup comedy.

They currently sit on the board of the alumni association, and they are very excited to have this opportunity to leverage their experience and connections to help others.
