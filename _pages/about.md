## What is Edspective?

To be perfectly honest, we don't quite know yet. But we have a semblance of a <a href="/plan" target="_blank">plan</a> and a burning will to help the world's education systems achieve their full potential. For now, let's call it a movement to lend a new perspective on college and admissions in the U.S., with the hope that this "edspective" will trickle down into feeder secondary and primary education systems.

## Who are we?

Nina Srivastava is a senior at Harvard, where she actively serves on the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/2/college-launches-honor-code/" target="_blank">Honor Council</a> and a number of other committees. She concentrates in Social Studies with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy. She plays bassoon in the Harvard Pops Orchestra, writes for the Harvard Book Review, participates in the cultural organization Dharma, and loves promoting a culture of integrity on her campus.

Andy Trattner is a recent graduate of MIT, where he studied mathematics with computer science (18c) and dabbled in creative writing. He cofounded <a href="https://lean0n.me/" target="_blank">Lean On Me</a>, a peer support movement with chapters on multiple college campuses, and he has work experience in aerospace engineering, teaching, social media, and venture capital. He plays chess, reads too much self-help, enjoys meeting new people, and appreciates efficiency.

Nina and Andy met as 2014 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Scholars_Program" target="_blank">U.S. Presidential Scholars</a> and went on to help the Department of Education run the program as Executive Advisors in 2017. During that time, they developed a deep respect and admiration for each other, and they decided to work together as much as possible in the future. They currently sit on the board of the alumni association, and they are very excited to have this opportunity to leverage their experience and connections to help others.
