### Email

Before you email us, please ask yourself:

1. Did I already submit something to the form above? Did I try emailing once? Do I really have so little faith in humanity?

2. Does my email contain original information? Is it so mindblowingly original that people's eyes pop out of their skulls when they read it?

3. Can my original information only be conveyed through the medium of email? Or can I turn attachments into links and help the nice Edspective people feel happy warm fuzzy with their current contact setup which they built specifically for me?

4. If they are making me read this horrible list before emailing, do they really want to receive email from me?

5. Is it an absolute super mega emergency?

And now answer yourself:

1. Yes, I do, but it's OK&mdash;we all do in today's day and age. But I appreciate them asking so much that they must have faith in me and I should have faith in them. I should trust that a response is forthcoming and no amount of following up will change that. Yeah, I would hate to receive some snooty email that says "hey, I put something in the form, go check it."

2. Probably not. Most or all of it is already in the <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/" target="_blank">Library of Babel</a>.

3. Also probably not. Wow, my earlier question was so helpful at providing an alternative way to communicate which will make everyone super joyful, yay!

4. No, the above form must be their preferred method of communication, so they probably review it regularly. Maybe I should use that, like, always.

5. I should call 911. Edspective is not an emergency service and it is doubtful that they can help me.
