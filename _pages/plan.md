According to a great <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html#part4" target="_blank">article</a> by Tim Urban, the "Elon Musk Company Formula" looks like this

and we are currently at the starting point.

Our industry of interest is education, and we have some ideas about high-level goals and results that might help the future of humanity. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves just yet. Right now let's focus on that tiny little arrow between starting point and sustainable business model.

For us, that arrow consists of three major steps:
1. Publish a book.
2. Turn this website into a forum.
3. Create a mentor network for students.

First, we are collecting hundreds of college students' stories and putting the best ones into our book, _The Shape of College_. Then, we will take the overflow stories, post them on this site for the public to enjoy, and add some form of comment / discussion functionality. Finally, we will offer a high-touch service matching high school with college students ready to help out with applications.

Because the Edspective movement is not yet a legal entity, the team will likely crowdfund and self-publish the book independently. We would like to put 80% of profits towards the above steps (including a small portion for team living expenses), and we want 20% of the profits to go to contributors. We roughly estimate that if we can get one book into just one quarter of all the high school libraries in the United States, those 10k sales would allow us to gift our target $250 to book contributors, $50 to website contributors, and $25 to referrals.

We differentiate ourselves in a few key ways. Most importantly, our philosophy is holistic. Even if our revenue stream is a college coaching service, we believe in equipping students with life skills and developing them as people rather than simply focusing on the strategic aspect of getting into certain schools. Secondarily, we plan to work with diverse and highly capable mentors, such as alumni of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Scholars_Program" target="_blank">U.S. Presidential Scholars Program</a>. Finally, although we will (hopefully) be profiting from our sustainable business model, we are ultimately directing our efforts toward the public good. To this end, we will always be seeking opportunities to help systematically disadvantaged populations, for example by providing a scholarship-based service to students who might not otherwise be able to afford college coaching.

There are some important details that we are still figuring out, and we would love your <a href="/feedback" target="_blank">input</a> on anything and everything that comes to mind!
