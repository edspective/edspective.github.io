### Last Week's Progress

- purchased domain edspective.org, built site + submission process
- from couple FB posts and emails, got 700 unique pageviews including 121 on /share with 2m45s average time on page
- lots of feedback, around 6 folks explicitly told me they are committed to a submission
- discovered Nina busy with thesis until early March, received multiple offers to help organizing team
- scheduled meeting with lawyer for Monday next week
- old boss gave tips on making sure people will _buy_ product not just _want_ it (potential interview on edspective topic)

### Next Steps

1. create a team with concrete roles, progress monitoring structure, transparent finances
2. publish a more detailed project timeline as anchor
3. generate content: sample submissions, video interviews, etc.
4. establish legalities
