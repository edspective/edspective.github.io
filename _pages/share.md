Can you speak for five minutes about how your view of the world has changed since leaving high school? Our target is to publish at least 100 such stories, which means we want to receive a lot of submissions, including yours.

Everything about this movement comes from the heart, but we understand that prioritizing volunteer work is challenging. We are driving a fast deadline&mdash;we want the first copies of _The Shape of College_ to be printed and sold by the beginning of May, just in time for graduation. We are offering a gift of up to $250 for timely submissions and up to $25 for each <a href="/refer" target="_blank">referral</a> (to be distributed later in the year depending on sales, see Selection Process).

***Initial submissions are due by Thursday Feb 15, 2018.***

Why should you share your story with us? Great question. We believe that there is a gap between the typical high school student's perception of college and the more holistic framing that we learn as adults. We don't think that anything out there adequately addresses this yet, so we are building <a href="/about" target="_blank">a shared vision and a butt-kicking team</a> to take action. We are convinced that your story can help students bridge the perspective gap.


## Book Format

The _Shape of College_ is a collection of student profiles. We want these stories to outline the interaction between positive and negative space&mdash;what's present in proportion to what's missing in your perspective on college, and more broadly, life? We are going for a vibe similar to <a href="https://www.portraitsofresilience.com/" target="_blank">Portraits of Reslience</a> or <a href="http://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank">Humans of New York</a>. 

Each profile will include three sections:
1. What we show the world. 
2. What we show admissions.
3. What we show no one.

The introduction to each profile will be a black and white headshot accompanied by a brief biographical blurb. Following this will be a sample college application of the profilee's choice. The last piece is a 3-5 page autobiographical narrative about something the application did not capture or how the subject's view of the world has changed since leaving high school. The idea is to move _beyond_.


## Submission Process

We estimate that you will require 5-7 hours over the course of 2 weeks. Give yourself an extra week of slack before the deadline, though!

You submission will include sections 2 and 3 from above, and we will contact you to obtain section 1 after reviewing your submission.

To prepare for your submission, you will need:
- a link to your favorite college application (as a PDF).
- readiness to share outcome of the app (<a href="/feedback" target="_blank">tell us</a> if not).
- a link to your autobiographical narrative (as a PDF).
- (optional) a title for your story.
- the name of the person who referred you, if any.
- readiness to accept Relationship Agreement below.
- email address where we can easily follow up with you.
- (optional) a complete list of your admissions outcomes.


<a href="/submit" target="_blank">**LINK TO SUBMISSION FORM**</a>. We strongly recommend that you please follow the Writing Process below.

## Writing Process

#### What We Need From You

How has your view of the world changed since leaving high school? Pick a single experience to write about. Some themes you may want to consider include family, religion, race, career / research, mental health / disabilities, romance / sexual / gender identity, leadership / activities / volunteering / sports. We want to emphasize nontraditional paths and possibilities, for instance taking a gap year or attending art school or whatever you consider different from the norm. Visit our <a href="/about" target="_blank">about page</a> to learn more about our angle.

We are deliberately vague about any specific prompt. We believe that whatever you find most interesting and pressing to share will help outline the contours of the college experience for readers. If you don't find this section helpful, but you still want to contribute, please feel free to write about whatever you like and share it with us. Also, you may write more than 5 pages and submit multiple narratives.

#### Timeline Steps (submit by Feb 15)

1. MAKE A <a href="drive.google.com" target="_blank">GOOGLE DRIVE</a> FOLDER. Name it "Shape of College Submission" or whatever you want. Put all your submission materials here. Drive will allow you to generate links to your PDFs, and it will auto-save so you never lose your hard work on accident. (Day 1 &ndash; 2 minutes)

2. FIND YOUR FAVORITE APPLICATION. Dig up your undergraduate applications and decide which you like most, or that you feel best represents you. Make a PDF and upload it to your Google Drive folder from step 1. (Day 1 &ndash; 8 minutes)

3. BRAINSTORM NARRATIVE TOPICS. Create a new doc in your Google Drive. Read over your favorite application and consider what is hidden or missing from it. This could be some aspect of life that you feel the application failed to capture. Or it could be some lesson or perspective shift you found later in life through college, work, a hobby, or other experience. In your doc, write a giant list of all the possible experiences you could write about. Take a break, thinking about your list and which items stand out. When you feel ready, start on step 4. (Day 1 &ndash; 30 minutes)

4. OUTLINE KEY POINTS. Create a new doc in your Google Drive. Choose an item from your brainstorm and paste it at the top of the page. Your outline should state the main components of your narrative, with maybe a sub-bullet or two. Think about how you would tell your outlined story to someone else. Does the organization of ideas flow well, with an introductory beginning, meaty middle, and satisfying end? When you feel ready, review your outline and modify it as needed. (Day 2 &ndash; 30 minutes)

5. BRAIN-BARF FIRST DRAFT OUT LOUD. Make a second copy of your outline above the first in your doc. We will expand this copy into a first draft. Pretend somebody asked you what your outline was, and you responded by narrating the whole thing. If it helps, close your eyes while you speak and type out your spoken words. You can definitely talk for 5-10 minutes, and this should be more than enough to convert your outline into 3-5 pages. You might think what you just wrote is garbage, but re-read it once you have finished and appreciate the good parts. Take a break, thinking about what you want to add or subtract in the revision process in terms of story structure. When you feel ready, start on step 6. (Day 2 &ndash; 30 minutes)

6. REVISE. Fix spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and generally prepare the story to be read by others. (Day 3 &ndash; 40 minutes)

7. SEEK FEEDBACK. If you like, ask friends, teachers, or mentors for input on your story. Make a copy of your draft in a new doc. Name the doc appropriately, click the "Share" button in the top right corner then "Get shareable link," and change "Anyone with the link can view" to "Anyone with the link can comment." Send the link along with any relevant background info from your college application to your reviewers and ask for a week-long turnaround. Send a reminder two days before your desired feedback deadline. (Day 3 &ndash; 20 minutes)

8. INCORPORATE FEEDBACK. Upon receiving suggestions, incorporate them if you wish into your draft, and be sure not to plagiarize! If you must, ask permission to use someone else's words as your own and get it signed in writing. Take a final break, perhaps for a couple days, before doing your final revision. (Day 10 &ndash; 1 hour)

9. FINAL DRAFT. If you wish, create a new doc and copy paste the most recent version of your draft. Format everything so it's nice and readable. Give your story a title if you like. Click "File" then "Download as" and select "PDF Document." Read your final draft with fresh eyes and ask, does this really say what I want? Revise one final time. (Day 12 &ndash; 45 minutes)

10. SUBMIT. Fill out the <a href="/submit" target="_blank">submission form</a> and you are done! (Day 13 &ndash; 15 minutes)

#### Tips and Tricks

- Don't worry about trying to fit too much into your 3-5 page narrative. The best stories have a clear focus. In the future, we hope to offer you more opportunities to share your stories!
- Keep in mind that showing the reader a situation and allowing her to draw her own conclusions is much more powerful than telling her what to think.
- If you are not feeling productive, take a break, walk around, clear your mind. Only writing when you feel motivated will save you time. We estimate that the whole process should take no longer than 6-7 dedicated hours over the course of two weeks.
- Break up your writing efforts into hour-long sprints over a few days. This will allow your brain to mull over various possibilities while you go about your daily life, and things will eventually click, maybe even while you are sleeping or showering!
- Tell someone right away if you decide to create a submission. Maybe this person can help give you feedback on your writing. Ask them to check in on you every couple days to keep you accountable.


## Selection Process and Referrals

We provide a <a href="/refer" target="_blank">referral form</a> to list any referrals made. For verification, we also ask at submission time for the name of the person who made the referral.

If all goes well (we like your submission, our team is not hit by a bus, etc.) and your submission is selected to be in _The Shape of College_ or published on our site, we will notify you and most likely ask for a single paragraph bio-blurb as well as a headshot&mdash;maybe a black and white selfie but we haven't decided quite yet. We may also ask for further revisions.

We don't yet know how we will be publishing the book, let alone unit economics and the legalities of distributing profits. For now, we are thinking to crowdfund pre-orders and self-publish. With a high-quality book, and help from you, we hope to generate 10,000 book sales in the first two months. We might guestimate a price of $18 per book with $10 production cost and $8 profit. We want to gift 20% of profits to contributors and referrals, so assuming we publish 60 web profiles and 40 book profiles and all of these are referrals, we will be able to give $250 to submissions ending up in the book, $50 to submissions ending up on our site, and $25 to each referral.

Of course, we will do our best do get all contributors a copy of the book, though if sales are awful, we may ask for the production cost to come out of the contributor gift. If we hit our publication goal of May, or even if we are a month behind schedule with June, we hope to give contributor gifts by mid-August.

If we are short of our target sales, we still want to gift contributors and referrals proportionally with 20% of profits. If we exceed our target sales, we will only gift up to the aforementioned amounts. All further profits, including those after the first two months of sales, will go in part toward living expenses of team members and mostly toward fueling future initiatives, possibly including a series of further books (relationships, job search, who knows)! For a more complete preview of what is to come, see our <a href="/plan" target="_blank">plan</a>.

Please share your thoughts with us on these topics via the comments section at the bottom of the page. We hope we are being transparent and clear that we cannot actually guarantee money at this time, but we fully intend to go through with this, make a big splash, and share many small pieces of a big pie.

## Relationship Agreement

_the following is included in both the submission and referral forms_

We ask that any contributor or referrer (the Participant) accept this Relationship Agreement with us (the Editors) so that we may both avoid scary lawsuits or other unpleasantness in the future.

As a Participant submitting my Story or Referral to the Editors, I agree:

I DIDN'T PLAGIARIZE. _that the entirety of the information I submit, transfer, or otherwise convey to the Editors is my property or original work. I have not copied, plagiarized, or otherwise infringed upon other's rights in representing this work as solely my own, and therefore the information conveyed is, for instance, fit for publication in a book medium with only my name as attribution for authorship._

YOU CAN USE WHAT I SEND YOU. _that any information I submit, transfer, or otherwise convey to the Editors may be freely copied, distributed, modified, sold, or otherwise used by the Editors at their discretion, including but not limited to publishing my work in a book or web medium, contacting me, or sending mail to my electronic or physical address, with or without attribution or notification to me. I will indemnify and hold harmless the Editors and their affiliates from liability to any third party and for any damages resulting from the use of my information. I hope that the Editors will notify me when they use my work, ask if I wish to remain anonymous, and so forth with other considerations that might be considered common courtesy, but I understand that they may forget or be unable to do so, and moreover, that they have no legal obligation to consult me before or after using my work, name, or other information._

I AM PARTICIPATING VOLUNTARILY. _that I was not coerced, manipulated, or otherwise forced against my will to submit, transfer, or otherwise convey information to the Editors. I have conveyed all information entirely voluntarily and without precondition. I understand that the Editors have no legal obligation to compensate me for use of any of the information I submit, transfer, or otherwise convey, and that any monetary gift that the Editors grant me is given entirely at their discretion and as an informal, personal thank-you rather than as payment for services between or among any parties. Furthermore, I understand that if I receive any such gift, it may be subject to tax and other applicable law with which I am responsible to comply. For the record, if the Editors choose to use my work or information, I hope that it contributes to an overall effort of sufficient quality and value that they are willing and able to gift me $250 at some future time if my work is used in a book medium, $50 if my work is not used in a book medium but instead posted on a website, and $25 if my referral for another Participant results in their work being used in either medium._

I HAVE COOPERATED AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. _that, to the best of my ability, I have and will abide by this Relationship Agreement as well as respond to communications, deadlines, and any other conditions or expectations set forth here or elsewhere by the Editors in a timely, responsible, and courteous manner. I understand that full decision-making power for the project lies with the Editors, that they will do their best to accommodate me, and that any requests for me to add to or modify my original work are not critiques or personal attacks but rather opportunities to create content which might better serve someone in the world. I recognize that this Agreement and other expectations, communications, or relationships between myself and the Editors are subject to change or termination at any time, at the discretion of the Editors._
