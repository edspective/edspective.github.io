We are seeking story submissions for _The Shape of College_, a book profiling the many different paths beyond high school and through the college application process. Contributors will receive a share of the book's profits.

Your submission will include your favorite college application and a 3-5 page autobiographical narrative. Your narrative can center on anything you want to share with young folks.

How has your confidence or worldview changed since high school? Was there something essential for you that was missing from your applications? When did you realize that college is a stepping stone rather than a goal in itself?

**<a href="/submit" target="_blank">Submit here!</a> Deadline is Thursday Feb 15, 2018.** If you don't want to share your college app or anything else, we would still love to have the rest. Just try writing something and send it in!

<details>
  <summary>Why should I share my story with you?</summary>
  <p>Great question. We believe that there is a perspective gap between high school and the rest of life. This gap is often widened by SAT prep classes, admissions books, and sad website forums. When high school students (and, honestly, some parents) think about college, a lot of worrisome thoughts tend to surface...status, stress, you know how admissions goes.</p>
  <p>We are convinced that hearing your and others' stories can help students grow beyond such thoughts. How awesome would it be if more students entered college already building their bridges across the perspective gap? By sharing your story, you are joining our <a href="/about" target="_blank">shared vision and butt-kicking team</a> in building a healthier perspective on education.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How long will it take?</summary>
  <p> If you are a fast writer, you could be done in an hour! However, we recommend you take 5-7 hours over the course of 2 weeks to produce the best possible submission. See recommended writing process for suggested timeline and steps.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What's needed to prepare my submission?</summary>
  <p>
    <li> a link to your favorite college application (as a PDF).</li>
    <li> a link to your autobiographical narrative (as a PDF).</li>
    <li> readiness to agree to the legalities (see below).</li>
    <li> the name of the person who referred you, if any.</li>
    <li> email address where we can easily follow up with you.</li>
    <li> (optional) a title for your story.</li>
    <li> (optional) list of your admissions outcomes.</li>
  </p>
  <p>We strongly recommend that you please follow the recommended writing process below.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How much do I actually have to write?</summary>
  <p>We welcome whatever you see fit to send us. We recommend 3-5 pages (double spaced if you like) to get the juices flowing, but please feel free to submit multiple stories, super short stories, or longer stories that exceed 5 pages.</p>
  <p>Don't worry about trying to fit too much into your narrative. The best stories have a clear focus. Just pick one thing and roll with it! In the future, we hope to offer you more opportunities to share your stories.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What if I don't know what to write about?</summary>
  <p>This is a perfectly valid and very normal way to feel. It can be hard to choose a topic, or to even think of any topics in the first place.</p>
  <p>We believe everyone has something to write about. Think of it this way. What if we asked you, "how has your view of the world changed since leaving high school? What key moments led to this new perspective?" You could probably think of something to say. In fact, you could probably speak for five minutes or more! That's all we ask. Write down verbatim those few minutes of talking, and you will have a decent first draft.</p>
  <p>Potential topics include relationships, career / major decisions, sexual / gender identity, race, family, socioeconomics, mental health / stress.
  In the theme of college as a stepping stone rather than a goal, highlighting alternative paths is also good: studying abroad, gap year, art school, whatever you consider to be different from the norm. It can be something that gets to the core of your evolving identity, but it doesn't have to be. Write about anything you feel comfortable with, big or small. Try picking a single experience and just going with it! It doesn't even have to be during college.</p>
  <p>We are deliberately vague about any specific prompt. We believe that whatever you find most interesting and pressing to share will help outline the contours of the college experience for readers. Please see the recommended writing process if you aren't sure how to proceed.</p>

  <summary>Is there a recommended writing process?</summary>
  <p><ol>
  <li><b>MAKE A <a href="drive.google.com" target="_blank">GOOGLE DRIVE</a> FOLDER.</b> Name it "Shape of College Submission" or whatever you want. Put all your submission materials here. Drive will allow you to generate links to your PDFs, and it will auto-save so you never lose your hard work on accident. (Day 1 &ndash; 2mins)</li>
  <li><b>FIND YOUR FAVORITE APPLICATION.</b> Dig up your undergraduate applications and decide which you like most, or that you feel best represents you. Make a PDF and upload it to your Google Drive folder from step 1. (Day 1 &ndash; 8mins)</li>
  <li><b>BRAINSTORM NARRATIVE TOPICS.</b> Create a new doc in your Google Drive. Read over your favorite application and consider what is hidden or missing from it. This could be some aspect of life that you feel the application failed to capture. Or it could be some lesson or perspective shift you found later in life through college, work, a hobby, or other experience. In your doc, write a giant list of all the possible experiences you could write about. Take a break, thinking about your list and which items stand out. When you feel ready, start on step 4. (Day 1 &ndash; 30 mins)</li>
  <li><b>OUTLINE KEY POINTS.</b> Create a new doc in your Google Drive. Choose an item from your brainstorm and paste it at the top of the page. Your outline should state the main components of your narrative, with maybe a sub-bullet or two. Think about how you would tell your outlined story to someone else. Does the organization of ideas flow well, with an introductory beginning, meaty middle, and satisfying end? When you feel ready, review your outline and modify it as needed. (Day 2 &ndash; 30mins)</li>
  <li><b>BRAIN-BARF FIRST DRAFT OUT LOUD.</b> Make a second copy of your outline above the first in your doc. We will expand this copy into a first draft. Pretend somebody asked you what your outline was, and you responded by narrating the whole thing. If it helps, close your eyes while you speak and type out your spoken words. You can definitely talk for 5-10 minutes, and this should be more than enough to convert your outline into 3-5 pages. You might think what you just wrote is garbage, but re-read it once you have finished and appreciate the good parts. Take a break, thinking about what you want to add or subtract in the revision process in terms of story structure. When you feel ready, start on step 6. (Day 2 &ndash; 30mins)</li>
  <li><b>REVISE.</b> Fix spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and generally prepare the story to be read by others. (Day 3 &ndash; 40mins)</li>
  <li><b>SEEK FEEDBACK.</b> If you like, ask friends, teachers, or mentors for input on your story. Make a copy of your draft in a new doc. Name the doc appropriately, click the "Share" button in the top right corner then "Get shareable link," and change "Anyone with the link can view" to "Anyone with the link can comment." Send the link along with any relevant background info from your college application to your reviewers and ask for a week-long turnaround. Send a reminder two days before your desired feedback deadline. (Day 3 &ndash; 20mins)</li>
  <li><b>INCORPORATE FEEDBACK.</b> Upon receiving suggestions, incorporate them if you wish into your draft, and be sure not to plagiarize! If you must, ask permission to use someone else's words as your own and get it signed in writing. Take a final break, perhaps for a couple days, before doing your final revision. (Day 10 &ndash; 60mins)</li>
  <li><b>FINAL DRAFT.</b> If you wish, create a new doc and copy paste the most recent version of your draft. Format everything so it's nice and readable. Give your story a title if you like. Click "File" then "Download as" and select "PDF Document." Read your final draft with fresh eyes and ask, does this really say what I want? Revise one final time. (Day 12 &ndash; 45mins)</li>
  <li><b>SUBMIT.</b> Fill out the <a href="/submit" target="_blank">submission form</a> and you are done! (Day 13 &ndash; 15mins)</li>
  </ol></p>

  <summary>Tips and tricks for writing effectively?</summary>
  <p>
  <li><b>SHOW DON'T TELL.</b> Keep in mind that showing the reader a situation and allowing her to draw her own conclusions is much more powerful than telling her what to think.</li>
  <li><b>ONLY WORK WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ZONE.</b> If you are not feeling productive, take a break, walk around, clear your mind. Only writing when you feel super motivated will save you time.</li>
  <li><b>WRITE DAILY IN SHORT BURSTS.</b> Break up your writing efforts into hour or shorter sprints over a few days. This will allow your brain to mull over various possibilities while you go about your daily life, and things will eventually click, maybe even while you are sleeping or showering!</li>
  <li><b>CREATE EXTERNAL ACCOUNTABILITY.</b> Tell someone right away if you decide to create a submission. Maybe this person can help give you feedback on your writing. Ask them to check in on you every couple days to keep you accountable.</li>

  <summary>How will the book be formatted?</summary>
  <p>The <i>Shape of College</i> is a collection of student profiles. We want these stories to outline the interaction between positive and negative space&mdash;what's present in proportion to what's missing in your perspective on college, and more broadly, life? We are going for a vibe similar to <a href="https://www.portraitsofresilience.com/" target="_blank">Portraits of Reslience</a> or <a href="http://www.humansofnewyork.com/" target="_blank">Humans of New York</a>.</p>
  <p> Each profile will include three sections:<ol>
  <li>What we show the world.</li>
  <li>What we show admissions.</li>
  <li>What we show no one.</li></ol></p>
  <p>The introduction to each profile will be a black and white headshot accompanied by a brief biographical blurb. We will collect this after reviewing initial submissions. Following the intro is a sample college application of the profilee's choice. The last piece is the autobiographical narrative about something the application did not capture or how the subject's view of the world has changed since leaving high school. The idea is to move beyond the confines of the traditional box to gain new perspective.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Can I submit anonymously?</summary>
  <p>We are more than happy to publish your story anonymously. If you want to remain anonymous even to the editors, feel free to submit fake info. We do ask that you give us an email we can reach you at, so we can get in touch with you to follow up in case of edits.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How will my story be used?</summary>
  <p>We will let you know what we do with your story via the email address you provide in the submission form. We may post your story on our website as a teaser preview of the book, or we might put in the book itself. It is also possible that we think of some other use, or that we decide not to use your story at all. Most likely, we will ask for some small revisions, or we might change some minor details ourselves (think spelling or sentence structure). In this case, we will be in touch throughout the editing process.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do referrals work?</summary>
  <p>We want help getting as many submissions as possible! This will help us to paint the broadest possible picture of <i>The Shape of College</i>.</p>
  <p>We verify referrals in two ways, both of which must be completed in order for the referral to be considered official.<ol>
  <li>We provide a <a href="/refer" target="_blank">referral form</a> for referrers to list any referrals made.</li>
  <li>We ask story submitters for the name of the person who made their referral.</li></ol>
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Do I get anything in return?</summary>
  <p>We unfortunately can't make any guarantees since we don't yet have any submissions, let alone a book. We hope that your primary motivation is the possibility to impact millions of lives around the globe by sharing your experiences!</p>
  <p>However, if all goes well in making and selling the book, we promise to share 20% of the first two months of sales profit with contributors, up to $250 for each story in the book, up to $50 for each overflow story posted on our website, and up to $25 for each <a href="/refer" target="_blank">referral</a> leading to a selected submission. We will of course do our best to get you a signed copy of the book.</p>
  <p>If we are short of our target sales (we think 10,000 books should do it), we will still gift contributors and referrals proportionally. If we do really super very poorly, we may not be able to send people free copies of the book. If we exceed our target sales, we will only gift up to the aforementioned amounts.</p>
  <p>All further profits, including those after the first two months of sales as well as from stories used past that point, will go toward fueling future initiatives, including team member compensation and potentially a series of further books (relationships, job search, who knows)! For a more complete preview of what is to come, see our <a href="/plan" target="_blank">plan</a>.</p>

  <summary>Explain the legalities?</summary>
  <p>Basically, we want to avoid lawsuits and other unpleasantness slash sadness. For this reason, we include a Relationship Agreement (between you the Participant and us the Editors) in both the referral and submission forms. Much of the legal stuff has to do with copyright and content ownership. There are three key points:<ol>
  <li>We have to be sure that you have the rights to all the information you give us. If not, that's called plagiarism, theft, or other things (all of which bring much sadness). We rely on your good word for this, since unlike trademarks or patents, there is no central database of stories, so it is pretty hard for us or anyone else to scour the universe and verify your claim of rights.</li> <!--helpful explanations from Gary Schall at WH Boston-->
  <li>We consider ourselves to be cultural landscapists, and we want to fully realize our artistic vision. To be certain we can do so, we ask that you give us full and permanent ownership of everything you submit to us. This will grant us control of the content, including rights to modify, sell, distribute, copy, or otherwise use the materials you submit. Technically, you would then have to ask us for permission to use the submitted material if you wanted to post it on a blog or something later. But don't worry, we probably won't mind&mdash;we just don't want to have to ask hundreds of you each time we change the font size for the book.</li>
  <li>We are big believers in open communication and front-loading expectations. We want to make sure that you are not being forced to do anything against your will (like submitting content to us). We also want to make sure you understand we cannot guarantee anything in return for your submission (we might all get hit by a bus, Google might go up in flames so we can't see your submission form, it might not end up aligning well with the final product, etc). However, we promise that if we do use what you provide us for the book or related online posts, we will compensate you according to the "Do I get anything in return?" section.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Why the rush?</summary>
  <p>We want to get books printed and sold by early May, in time for high school graduation gifts! It would be sad if we got delayed until the end of 2018, but it would be even worse if we aimed for December 2018 and got delayed until 2019...so we are driving hard and fast deadlines, encouraging folks to jump on board quickly.</p>
