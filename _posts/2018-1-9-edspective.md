How do you view the world differently than your high school self?
What brought about this new perspective?

Every year, more than 3 million students graduate high school in the U.S. The majority of these students attend college, and many more come internationally. But very few of them are truly ready for it.

One problem is our culture, translated into the education system. We ask young children to think of their dream jobs: doctor, astronaut, president, movie star. Then we ask high school students a narrower question: to identify their dream schools. College becomes an endpoint, a goal in itself. It becomes the riverbank on the far side of the water, rather than a stepping stone to help get across. We lose sight of the larger picture.

How can we help students internalize a healthy perspective on college and the admissions process?

Maybe it's impossible. A bunch of guidebooks and self-help manuals already exist. There are resources out there to help students with nearly every aspect of college and life. Perhaps nothing can substitute for the experience itself&mdash;the personal successes and failures that we all learn to live beyond.

But maybe we can do something. What if just a few spoken minutes of your story helps a parent realize that sometimes the best parenting is no parenting at all? Perhaps they will give their children more space to think and act and learn independently. What if just a five page snippet of your experience resonates with a student? Perhaps she will better navigate and understand herself, the world, and the admissions process.

Our society is on the verge of a cultural perspective shift that will sweep across the education landscape within the next few years. As a gentle push in the right direction, we are creating _The Shape of College_, a collection of student profiles we hope to publish in book form by May 2018.
