Maybe it's impossible. A bunch of guidebooks and self-help manuals already exist. There are resources out there to help students with nearly every aspect of college and life. Perhaps nothing can substitute for the experience itself&mdash;the personal successes and failures that we all learn to live beyond.

But maybe we can do something. What if just a few spoken minutes of your story helps a parent realize that sometimes the best parenting is no parenting at all? Perhaps they will give their children more space to think and act and learn independently. What if just a five page snippet of your experience resonates with a student? Perhaps she will better navigate and understand herself, the world, and the admissions process.

Our society is on the verge of a cultural perspective shift that will sweep across the education landscape within the next few years. As a gentle push in the right direction, we are creating _The Shape of College_, a collection of student profiles we hope to publish in book form by May 2018.
